        description:"My very first trip to China would've have been complete without a trip to The Great Wall (one of the seven wonders of the world). I stayed out till 4 a.m., and had to be up at 7 for the tour, but it was so worth it. Unfortunately the night before while walking through the night market (also pictured) a guy swept trash on me and i almost slipped, but successfully managed to sprain my knee just hours before I would be hiking up The Wall. But I was determined and the journey to the top was well worth the view. The pictures don't do it justice. I can't even begin to describe how beautiful and peaceful it is standing on the wall surrounded by nature creation of mountains abound. Frankly, I think nature was competing with the wall... and won.",

        description:"Fell in love with this little town on what was supposed to be a 3-country tour: France, Italy, and Spain. Unfortunately, I never made it to Spain. The town was so beautiful and the weather was great. I spent the remainder of my vacation having lazy breakfasts on the balcony , browsing the shops, walking down to the beach everyday and occasionally hoping the bus to see other towns like Ravello ...and yes Almafi",

        description:"My 3Xth birthday! I rarely celebrate my birthday so when I do I like to do something amazing and memorable. Well my trip to Niagra falls definitely surpassed expectations. We stayed in Toronto booked a $60 tour buss that taked you to the falls, wineries, and Niagra on the Lake - the helicopter ride was ofcourse extra but it was worth every dime and was the highlight of the experience. It was me and one of my best friends having the most amazing 30 minutes ever (haha) Unfortunately, I was too excited to take any good pictures, but the memory of the views will last a life time. ",
