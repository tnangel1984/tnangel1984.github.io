        description:"My very first trip to China would've have been complete without a trip to The Great Wall (one of the seven wonders of the world). I stayed out till 4 a.m., and had to be up at 7 for the tour, but it was so worth it. Unfortunately the night before while walking through the night market (also pictured) a guy swept trash on me and i almost slipped, but successfully managed to sprain my knee just hours before I would be hiking up The Wall. But I was determined and the journey to the top was well worth the view. The pictures don't do it justice. I can't even begin to describe how beautiful and peaceful it is standing on the wall surrounded by nature creation of mountains abound. Frankly, I think nature was competing with the wall... and won.",
